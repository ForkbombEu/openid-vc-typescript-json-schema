# JSON Schemas and TypeScript definitions for OpenID's Verfiable Credential Issuance

Hello dev! ðŸš€
In this repo you'll find some JSON and TS utilities for working with OpenID's Verfiable Credential Issuance.

The reference for the code is the [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance - Editor's draft](https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html#name-introduction).

This is a work in progress.
